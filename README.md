## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure
- **Minimal Components**: Only essential components to avoid over-engineering
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Prop Drilling**: Simple prop passing instead of complex state management
- **Reusable Utilities**: Common functions extracted to utility files

### Styling Approach
- **Component-Specific CSS**: Each component has its own stylesheet for maintainability
- **Global Styles**: Common styles and utilities in main App.css
- **CSS Variables**: Dark mode implementation using CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized Computations**: Expensive operations cached with useMemo
- **Efficient Filtering**: Optimized search and filter algorithms
